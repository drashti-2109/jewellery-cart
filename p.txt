Winston - logging library for centralized error logging

* What is Centralized Error Logging?
-> Instead of using console.error(...) everywhere, we create one reusable logger file.
-> You just import it and call logger.error(...).
-> It saves logs to files and/or prints clean logs in the terminal.


Remaining
1. Indexing in MongoDB
2. Rate Limiting
3. Move Token Handling to Cookie (Optional but safer for Web)


* When Should You Use Aggregation?
-> Joining data (like SQL joins)	
EG: Populate userâ€™s orders, stats, logs, etc.

-> Data transformation	
EG: Calculate age from DOB, fullName from first+last

-> Advanced filtering	
EG: Filter users by region, device, login stats

-> Grouping/Statistics	
EG: Group users by country, gender, usage activity

-> Pagination + Facets	
EG: Efficient pagination with meta info (e.g., total pages)
